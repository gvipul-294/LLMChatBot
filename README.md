# LLM-chatBot
a project to develop a simple chatBot

## Overview
In this project, we used public information to build a chatbot that provides information in a conversation environment. Our project aims to implement a model that can respond to questions within a confined context.

## What the model does
The model uses a curated list of questions and answers about public library services in Winnipeg as a confined context and responds to user inputs accordingly. 

## What's next for LLM ChatBot
We want to build the ChatBot with a friendly user interface, process accordingly even the user input with typos, and build a more automatic pipeline to ingest data as a corpus.
